# 3D GIF

As with previous projects, we are providing these ideas for extensions to the project at its current state.  We'll get started on them in class, but hope you will use these in whatever way makes sense for you.  Use them to familiarize yourself with the 3D GIF project, as mini-tutorials on how to use do specific things with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  Give them a try, and let us know if you have any questions.

1. Make the 'LEDs' fade as they move back through the slices of the cube.
1. Make an 'LED' disappear after it reaches the back slice.
1. Make it so pressing a letter creates the letter on the front slice of the cube and sends it towards the back.
1. Find a way to save the state of your browser-based cube so you can access it later.
1. Extend the code so that you can reproduce the above behavior for the other directions (top to bottom and left to right).
